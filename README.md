Save the Children Helper will be an online website that compiles all the authentic donation links (e.g: Savethechildren.org) and other methods to help the people in Gaza. We will check the organizations for authenticity and then add them and the details about them to our site so the user can decide for themselves which site they want to donate to. Our website will also act as a place to unveil the true news and updates of the ongoing war in Gaza because as we knows Western Media and all sites controlled by them are trying to hide the true extent of the atrocities being committed by Israel and their crimes against humanity.
